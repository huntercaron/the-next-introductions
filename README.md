# The Next Introductions

Introducing the next graduating class.

Using GSAP, Gatsby, Netlify CMS.

## Getting Started

### Things you Need Installed
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

### After installing, clone the repository using either the terminal or Github Desktop.

### First Setup

After cloning the repo, open your terminal and `cd` to the directory and run `yarn`.
This will install all the dependencies for the project.

### Running Locally

Once that is done, get the site running and live-reloading by running `gatsby develop`.

You're good to go! Your site will be at http://localhost:8000/.

## Docs & Guides
- For other Gatsby commands look [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).
- I also strongly recommended the Gatsby tutorial [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).
- If using Netlify, simply commit to your site and it will rebuild.
- If using Github pages, follow the guide [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/deploy-gatsby/#github-pages).

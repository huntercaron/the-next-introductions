description: >
  Sometimes pages have little bits of text rather than a main body section for
  weirder layouts. Formatting text in frontmatter like this allows you to have
  named little nodes of information.


  This information isn't actually inserted in the page, you can add it similar
  to how we added the list in the template file.

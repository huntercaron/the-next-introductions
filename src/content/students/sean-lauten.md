blurb: >-
  Design is about solving problems. Whether itâ€™s tinkering with the tools in
  front of me or imagining the possibilities that lay beyond, I love figuring
  things out. Design allows me to discover new ways of constructing pieces that
  fit together and make something greater as a whole.

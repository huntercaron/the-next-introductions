blurb: >-
  I believe in using design as a communication tool. I love exploring the
  narrative of a story, and helping the audience to visualize it and experience
  it on a deeper level when they are interacting or viewing it. Design gives
  people a platform to share their stories beyond words and provoke powerful
  emotions.

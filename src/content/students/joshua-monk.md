blurb: >
  To me, each design project is an opportunity to learn something new. By
  researching a problem in detail, I find that the ideal design solution becomes
  clear. By becoming a designer, I want to be in a position where my work is
  seen as meaningfulÿ±nothing is more valuable to me than the praise for a job
  well done.

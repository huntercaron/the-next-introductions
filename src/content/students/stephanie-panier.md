blurb: >
  I believe in using design as a method of entertainment. I like to create
  designs that are whimsical, light-hearted and amusing. It is important to have
  fun in your work and it makes the job a lot easier and enjoyable when you love
  what you do and have the ability to have fun. Sometimes, design is taken too
  seriously and it doesn't have to be.
